Initial|Dearest Journal,|Monsieur Beaucoup has offered to be my patron if I am attracted to the offer and the particulars of the arrangement. I am quite taken with Beaucoup and have always admired him, but things have been going well with Paul and I do value financial independence. Should I: |Take Beaucoup’s tawdry patron arrangement?|Agreement|Or should I instead double my work efforts, picking up extra labor where I can and try to sell portraits to keep things afloat?|Warrior@

Agreement|Dearest Journal,|I passed Beaucoup’s wife on the street today, she is with child. I am just a passing fad to him, and the love and protection I felt is finite. Should I:|Get over him any way I can think of?|Party| Or seek solace in the company of other artists like myself?|Commune@

Warrior|Dearest Journal,|Freedom and independence are difficult no matter the avenue you take. I’ve been working myself to the bone to try and make ends meet, and I am utterly exhausted. But the big exhibition is coming to the city next year and more than anything I’d like to show in it. How can I ensure this happens?| I will network and make connections…|Party| Or I could focus on producing new art, at all costs.|Depression|@

Party|Dearest Journal,|It’s strange how much of life you can and can’t control, and it’s never quite as easy or hard as it seems… I’ve perhaps gotten too far with enhancers but it improves my art, or at least, my professional connections. Still, the party life is exciting and gives me plenty to draw on. I’m pleased with that.|||||@

Commune|Dearest Journal,|Had I known situating myself in a collective would have made things easier I’d never have bothered with school. I learn just as much from one skill sharing with a fellow artist than I do in a whole week of classes. I guess I needed the structure, but life has been good to me either way. And what would I do without Fluffy, Scratchy, Furry, Whiskers, and Georg? Thank goodness Paul loves them as much as I, and thank goodness I have ended up with him in my life, he helps me stay balanced.|||||@

Depression|Dearest Journal,|The meaning of things continually slip through my grasp. I try to find the value in art but it feels like a dog chasing its tail. I’ll continue to work at it, what else is there to do?|||||@
